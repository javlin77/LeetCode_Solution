# LeetCode Java Solutions – Curated by Difficulty

This is a curated collection of **my Java-based LeetCode solutions**, organized by difficulty level: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.

## Difficulty-Based Organization

While solving problems on LeetCode, I noticed that most challenges can't be neatly classified under a single category like "Array" or "Dynamic Programming." Real-world problems often blend multiple ideas — a matrix-based question might involve recursion, greedy logic, or even sliding windows.

Instead of organizing problems by:
- **Data Structures** like Arrays, HashMaps, Queues, etc.
- **Strategies** like Recursion, Greedy, Dynamic Programming
- **Formats** like Strings, Matrices

I chose to **categorize them by difficulty level**, which reflects the true nature of the problem-solving process. This structure better supports progressive learning.
